# Brainfp

This is a naive [Brainfuck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) interpreter
written in Scala. It can probably run all possible Brainfuck programs, but it
hasn't been too thoroughly tested.

Todo:

* Rewrite the evaluation code to be stateless/immutable
* Add functions to encode a string as a Brainfuck program
* Make a Scala.js version for fun
